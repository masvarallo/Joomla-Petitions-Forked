# Joomla Petitions - forked

This is a forked instance of Joomla Petitions. This became necessary because of severe security holes and other visible issues like missing translations.

Although this is not actively developed by me, feel free to submit issues. I will still fix bugs in main functionality and security issues.

For the other issues, feel free to contribute! :)
